      <p>The Church of the Province of Myanmar (CPM) is getting used to responding to emergencies. When an earthquake struck the Dioceses of Mandalay and Taungoo in March 2025, the church and its network of volunteers were quick to respond.</p>
      
      <p>Thanks to the generosity of our supporters, ABM AID was able to support the distribution of food relief and cash assistance to more than 500 earthquake-affected families across both dioceses.</p>
      
      <p>This included special cash assistance packages to people living with disability, as well as to families that were hosting other displaced families. Local volunteers actively worked together with CPM and diocesan staff to organise the relief distributions.</p>

      <p>In June this year, CPM will begin reconstruction of community buildings. Due to the imminent arrival of the rainy season in Myanmar, reconstruction needs to begin as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>We would like to profoundly thank ABM AID supporters for their generous response to our Myanmar Earthquake Emergency Appeal, which remains open.</p>
      <p>We are also grateful to other Anglican agencies overseas, and to CPM and diocesan staff and volunteers: everyone has played their part in helping families get back on their feet after the earthquake.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the catastrophic 7.7 magnitude earthquake that has ravaged the Mandalay-Sagaing region, the Church of the Province of Myanmar (CPM) mourns the devastating damage inflicted upon our historic St. Mary’s Church (Anglican). A venerable cornerstone of the Diocese of Mandalay, our red-brick church, which has stood as a bastion of Anglican faith and community service for generations, is now heartbreakingly broken.</p>
      <p>As the Primate of the Church of the Province of Myanmar, the Most Rev. Stephen Than, has stated, the crisis is "overwhelming." Yet, in accordance with our Anglican tradition—rooted in Scripture, Tradition, and Reason—we look not only to the material damage but to the spiritual resilience of our community.</p>    
      
      <h3>The Material Toll on a Sacred Space</h3>
      <p>
      The severity of the tremor, with its epicenter near our city, is visible in every corner of our compound. 
      The physical wounds to <strong>St. Mary’s</strong> are profound:

         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h4>Collapse of the Upper Structure</h4>
      <p>
      The very crown of our sanctuary has been struck. The upper brickwork and parapet have given way entirely, 
      scattering debris and leaving the roofline exposed and vulnerable. 
      That a structure built to endure for a century could be so severely compromised 
      speaks to the immense power of this natural disaster.

      <h4>A Raining Down of Ruin</h4>
      <p>
      The interior bears a painful testament to the violence of the shaking. 
      Areas surrounding the sanctuary and within other church rooms are filled with the rubble of collapsed masonry, 
      plaster, and shattered furniture. 
      Though the main altar remains, it is now surrounded by the detritus of the fallen building, 
      a sobering scene that reminds us of the fragility of our earthly structures.

      <h4>The Wider Impact</h4>
      <p>
      Beyond our main church, the adjacent church grounds and compound are strewn with bricks and debris. 
      This damage is a microcosm of the devastation across the entire <strong>Diocese of Mandalay</strong>, 
      is working closely to respond to the catastrophic needs of our parishes.

      <h3>The Living Church Responds</h3>
      <p>While we grieve the loss of our beautiful edifice, the true Church—the body of Christ in Myanmar—is mobilized. In the spirit of the Anglican commitment to mission and service, our focus is immediately shifting to pastoral and humanitarian relief.</p>
      <h4>A Place of Refuge</h4>
      <p>Our church buildings, even those damaged, are being pressed into service. Archdeacon Joseph Yin Oo and our diocesan staff are working tirelessly with volunteers, distributing emergency supplies—food, water, and temporary shelter materials—to affected parishioners and the wider community, including those of non-Christian faiths. Our churches are being transformed into immediate centers of refuge.</p>
      <h4>Partnership and Prayer</h4>
      <p>We stand in solidarity with the Church of the Province of Myanmar's Disaster Management Committee. We are grateful for the swift response from our partners in the global Anglican Communion, including the Anglican Alliance, who are helping us coordinate resources for the urgent phase of relief and the monumental task of rehabilitation and reconstruction that lies ahead.</p>
      
      <p>We humbly ask the worldwide Anglican Communion and all people of goodwill to join us in prayer for the countless lives lost and injured, for the thousands left homeless, and for the fortitude of our clergy, Mothers' Union, and volunteers as they embody the love of Christ in this time of unparalleled suffering. Our building may be shaken, but our faith in God’s providence and our commitment to serving our neighbours remain resolute.</p>
      
      <p>We take comfort in these words as we begin the arduous process of rebuilding our sacred home.</p>
