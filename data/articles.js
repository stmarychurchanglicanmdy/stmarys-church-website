      <p>The Church of the Province of Myanmar (CPM) is getting used to responding to emergencies. When an earthquake struck the Dioceses of Mandalay and Taungoo in March 2025, the church and its network of volunteers were quick to respond.</p>
      
      <p>Thanks to the generosity of our supporters, ABM AID was able to support the distribution of food relief and cash assistance to more than 500 earthquake-affected families across both dioceses.</p>
      
      <p>This included special cash assistance packages to people living with disability, as well as to families that were hosting other displaced families. Local volunteers actively worked together with CPM and diocesan staff to organise the relief distributions.</p>

      <p>In June this year, CPM will begin reconstruction of community buildings. Due to the imminent arrival of the rainy season in Myanmar, reconstruction needs to begin as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>We would like to profoundly thank ABM AID supporters for their generous response to our Myanmar Earthquake Emergency Appeal, which remains open.</p>
      <p>We are also grateful to other Anglican agencies overseas, and to CPM and diocesan staff and volunteers: everyone has played their part in helping families get back on their feet after the earthquake.</p>

    excerpt: 'Exploring themes of hope and faith in everyday life through Scripture and shared reflection.',

      <p>Faith and hope are not mere concepts to be understood intellectually, but living realities that shape how we navigate the joys and challenges of daily life. Our recent sermon series has explored these foundational themes through Scripture, prayer, and community reflection.</p>
      
      <p>Over the course of six weeks, we have journeyed through biblical passages that illuminate the nature of faith and hope, examining how these gifts from God can transform our perspective and strengthen our resolve in difficult times.</p>
      
      <h2>Weekly Themes</h2>
      <p>Each week of our series focused on a different aspect of faith and hope:</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 1: Faith as Trust</strong><br>
      We explored how faith is fundamentally about trust in God's character and promises, even when circumstances are uncertain.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 2: Hope in Adversity</strong><br>
      Through the stories of biblical figures who faced tremendous challenges, we learned about hope that persists even in the darkest moments.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 3: Community of Faith</strong><br>
      We examined how faith is strengthened and sustained through community, and how we can support one another in our spiritual journeys.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 4: Active Hope</strong><br>
      This week focused on hope as more than passive waiting, but as an active force that motivates us to work for justice and healing in our world.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 5: Faith in Daily Life</strong><br>
      We discussed practical ways to live out our faith in everyday situations, from family relationships to work responsibilities.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Week 6: Hope for the Future</strong><br>
      Our final week looked at the ultimate hope we have in God's kingdom and how that hope shapes our present actions and attitudes.</p>
      
      <h2>Continuing the Conversation</h2>
      <p>While our formal sermon series has concluded, the conversation about faith and hope continues in our small groups, prayer meetings, and daily interactions. We encourage all members of our community to reflect on how these themes apply to their own spiritual journey.</p>
      
      <p>If you missed any of the sermons in this series, recordings are available, and we would be happy to discuss these themes with you personally. Faith and hope are gifts that grow stronger when shared with others.</p>
