                        <h3>Origins Amid Colonial Mandalay</h3>
                        <p>European civilian residents in Mandalay, unlike military personnel, worshipped at Christ Church, but often found the service hours inconvenient. As early as 1891 they had their own “Town Chaplain” but still no dedicated church building.</p>
                        
                        <p>A site was eventually secured on South Moat Road, and fundraising commenced. Rev. C. W. Hodder, A.C.S. Chaplain, took the lead; he acted not only as the spiritual head of the project but also as the architect, contractor, and superintendent of works.</p>

                        <h3>Foundation, Construction, and Consecration</h3>
                        <p>The foundation stone was intended to be laid on February 2, 1901, but the event was delayed by the illness and death of Queen Victoria. It was finally laid on February 16, 1901, by The Right Reverend John Miller, Bishop of Rangoon (D.D.M.D.).</p>
                        
                        <p>Exactly one year later, on February 16, 1902, St. Mary's  was consecrated by Bishop Dr. Strachan, with a Confirmation service held that same evening.</p>

                        <h3>Community, Interfaith Support and Legacy</h3>
                        <p>One-eighth of the money raised came from non-Christian supporters, illustrating the interfaith cooperation in Mandalay:
                            Two Hindoo gentlemen gave the reredos (altar screen)
                            A Parsee donated the nave carpet
                            A Mohammedan (Muslim) contributed the Chancel Screen
                            Buddhists offered a processional cross and precious stones for the altar cross</p>
                        <p>In the broader scope, the Anglican Church had been active in Myanmar since the 19th century not only in church-planting but also in education. Institutions like Saint Mary’s in Maymyo and Saint Michael’s in Mandalay were part of this network.</p>
                        <p>St. Mary's Church still stands today as a symbol of both religious faith and cultural unity, and occupies an important place in Mandalay's colonial and post-colonial religious history.</p>
